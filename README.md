# softBodyOnWater
A 2D simulation of soft hydrophobic spheres falling in water. They have an optional driving force to keep them moving. 
Here are some neat examples:
1) Single hydrophobic sphere falling on water:

3) 5 hydrophobic spheres falling on water with excluded volumes, driven by a random force:
